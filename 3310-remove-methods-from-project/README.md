<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-methods-from-project">Remove Methods From Project</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-orange' alt='Difficulty: Medium' /><hr><p>You are maintaining a project that has <code>n</code> methods numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>

<p>You are given two integers <code>n</code> and <code>k</code>, and a 2D integer array <code>invocations</code>, where <code>invocations[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that method <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> invokes method <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>.</p>

<p>There is a known bug in method <code>k</code>. Method <code>k</code>, along with any method invoked by it, either <strong>directly</strong> or <strong>indirectly</strong>, are considered <strong>suspicious</strong> and we aim to remove them.</p>

<p>A group of methods can only be removed if no method <strong>outside</strong> the group invokes any methods <strong>within</strong> it.</p>

<p>Return an array containing all the remaining methods after removing all the <strong>suspicious</strong> methods. You may return the answer in <em>any order</em>. If it is not possible to remove <strong>all</strong> the suspicious methods, <strong>none</strong> should be removed.</p>

<p>Method 2 and method 1 are suspicious, but they are directly invoked by methods 3 and 0, which are not suspicious. We return all elements without removing anything.</p>

<div class="example-block">
<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="example-io">n = 5, k = 0, invocations = [[1,2],[0,2],[0,1],[3,4]]</span></p>

<p>Methods 0, 1, and 2 are suspicious and they are not directly invoked by any other method. We can remove them.</p>

<p>All methods are suspicious. We can remove them.</p>

## Solution Explanation

### Intuition
The problem can be modeled as a directed graph where methods are nodes and invocations are directed edges. We can identify all suspicious methods by finding every node reachable from the buggy method. The key insight is that this suspicious group can only be safely removed if there are absolutely no incoming edges from the set of non-suspicious nodes into the set of suspicious nodes.

### Approach
- Construct an adjacency list to represent the directed graph of method invocations.
- Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from method `k` to traverse the graph and mark all reachable methods as suspicious.
- Iterate through the original list of invocations to verify the removal condition: check if there is any edge `u -> v` where `u` is not suspicious but `v` is suspicious.
- If such an edge is found, the suspicious group is still being relied upon by the rest of the project, meaning we cannot remove them and must return all `n` methods.
- If no such edge exists, the suspicious methods are safely isolated, so we iterate from `0` to `n - 1` and return only the methods that are not marked as suspicious.

### Complexity
- **Time:** O(n + m) — where n is the number of methods and m is the number of invocations, as we build the graph, perform a BFS traversal, and do a single pass over the edges.
- **Space:** O(n + m) — to store the adjacency list, the queue for BFS, and the boolean array tracking suspicious methods.
