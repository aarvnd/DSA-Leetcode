<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer">Roman to Integer</a></h2> <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen' alt='Difficulty: Easy' /><hr><p>Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols:&nbsp;<code>I</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>M</code>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Symbol</strong>       <strong>Value</strong>
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000</pre>

<p>For example,&nbsp;<code>2</code> is written as <code>II</code>&nbsp;in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. <code>12</code> is written as&nbsp;<code>XII</code>, which is simply <code>X + II</code>. The number <code>27</code> is written as <code>XXVII</code>, which is <code>XX + V + II</code>.</p>

<p>Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not <code>IIII</code>. Instead, the number four is written as <code>IV</code>. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as <code>IX</code>. There are six instances where subtraction is used:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>I</code> can be placed before <code>V</code> (5) and <code>X</code> (10) to make 4 and 9.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><code>X</code> can be placed before <code>L</code> (50) and <code>C</code> (100) to make 40 and 90.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><code>C</code> can be placed before <code>D</code> (500) and <code>M</code> (1000) to make 400 and 900.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;III&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> III = 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;LVIII&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 58
<strong>Explanation:</strong> L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;MCMXCIV&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 1994
<strong>Explanation:</strong> M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 15</code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> contains only&nbsp;the characters <code>(&#39;I&#39;, &#39;V&#39;, &#39;X&#39;, &#39;L&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;, &#39;M&#39;)</code>.</li>
	<li>It is <strong>guaranteed</strong>&nbsp;that <code>s</code> is a valid roman numeral in the range <code>[1, 3999]</code>.</li>
</ul>

## Solution Explanation

### Intuition
The core insight is that Roman numerals are simply summed up from left to right, with one exception: if a smaller numeral appears immediately before a larger one, it acts as a subtraction rather than an addition. By peeking at the next character during our traversal, we can instantly decide whether to add or subtract the current numeral's value.

### Approach
- Initialize a running total variable to keep track of the final integer value.
- Iterate through the given string character by character from left to right.
- Use a helper method with a switch statement to map the current Roman character to its integer equivalent.
- Check if there is a subsequent character in the string; if so, retrieve its integer value as well.
- Compare the two values: if the current value is less than the next value, subtract the current value from the running total (handling cases like IV or IX).
- Otherwise (or if it is the last character in the string), simply add the current value to the running total.

### Complexity
- **Time:** O(N) — We iterate through the string of length N exactly once, performing constant-time lookups and arithmetic operations.
- **Space:** O(1) — We only use a few primitive integer variables for the running total and value comparisons, requiring no extra scaling memory.
